# Predictive Modeling of Postoperative Pain in Endodontic Treatment

This repository contains the code and general workflow for a study focused on the development of machine learning models to predict postoperative pain following endodontic treatment of irreversible pulpitis cases.

The project explores the application of various supervised machine learning algorithms, including tree-based methods, ensemble models, linear models, instance-based models, neural networks, and margin-based classifiers. The goal is to build predictive tools capable of assisting clinical decision-making by identifying patients at higher risk of experiencing moderate to severe postoperative pain.

The models were trained and validated using structured clinical data collected from patients undergoing standardized endodontic treatment protocols. Performance evaluation included metrics such as AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with confidence intervals estimated through bootstrap resampling to ensure robustness.

This repository is intended to ensure methodological transparency and reproducibility. Detailed results, data, and interpretations are not disclosed publicly to maintain confidentiality until the related manuscript is officially published.
